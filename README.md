I am a new learner who strives to be a full-stack developer, create fun projects, and as well as one day help contribute to open-source projects with the knowledge gain from my coding journey!

- I'm currently learning Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- You can reach me ismaelhuerta100@gmail.com
- Fun fact is that I love to watch crime documentary!
